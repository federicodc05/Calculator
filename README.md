# Calculator
Hello!
This is a working calculator for Python. This is also my first work that uses classes, and oh boy those things simplyfy programs by alot!
Anyway, this is just an Alpha version, so it might be lacking of features.

<h1>Beta has arrived! </h1>
This Update is dedicated to Binary numbers! They're still a little buggy, but usable 

<h2> Update Beta 1.3.2 </h2>
*Added Scrollbar to calculus function entry

<h2> Update Beta 1.3.1 </h2>
*Added factoring and expanding polynomials <br>
*Added Pythagorean Triple Generator (PTG) <br>
*Bug fixes

<h2> Update Beta 1.3 </h2>
*Bug fixes relative to quadratic calculator <br>
*Added calculus stuff: <br>
<tt>derivatives of a function </tt><br>
<tt>indefinite integral of a function </tt><br>
<tt>definite integral from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> of a function</tt><br>
<tt>limit of a function</tt>

<h2>Work in Progress/Planned:</h2>
*Hyperbolic Functions (Unlikely to be added due to appoximation and restricted domain) <br>

<h2> Update Beta 1.2.1 </h2>
*Added Quadratic Equation Calculator. (ax^2 + bx + c = 0)

<h2> Update Beta 1.2 </h2>
*Added graphing capabilities for the following functions: <br>
<tt>cos(x)</tt><br>
<tt>sin(x)</tt><br>
<tt>tan(x)</tt><br>
<tt>cos(x)</tt><br>
<tt>e^x</tt><br>
<tt>x^k</tt><br>
<tt>sqrt(x)</tt><br>
<tt>plolynomials & more</tt><br>

<h2> Update Beta 1.1 </h2>
*Fixed switching between base-10 and base-2 <br>
*Added error function, gamma function and n-th root <br>
*Added Dark Mode on binary <br>
*Improved file managing

<h2> Update Beta 1.0 </h2>
*Added Binary numbers <br>
*Added bitwiese AND, OR, XOR, NOT operators <br>
*Added "bin" button to switch to binary mode, but there is no going back! once you enter binary mode, you have to restart to get back to base 10 (button is a placeholder)

<h2>Update Alpha 1.3 </h2>
*Added powers
*Added base-10 and base-e logs
*Added exponential function

<h2>Update Alpha 1.2: </h2>
