# Calculator
Hello!
This is a working calculator for Python. This is also my first work that uses classes, and oh boy those things simplyfy programs by alot!
Anyway, this is just an Alpha version, so it might be lacking of features.
Report any issue you find (Salvo sto guardando a te)

Update Alpha 1.1: <br>
 *Fixed button sizes <br>
 *Added indicator of operation sideways
